The Ring buildpack for Heroku (Forked from The official PHP buildpack for Heroku.)

Contains Apache + Support for Ring (Through CGI)

The package will detect the project by looking at the file : index.ring 

You need to add the Ring language files to your project (Add Ring binary release for Ubuntu Linux - 64bit)
